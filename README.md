# CS50 Web Programming Project - Commerce

Welcome to my third project for the CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course.  
In this project, I have designed an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that allows users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a "watchlist."

## Project Demo

I've prepared a video demonstration of this project to showcase its functionality and features.  
You can watch the demo to gain a better understanding of how the project works and see it in action.

# CS50 Web Programming Project - Auction

Welcome to my third project for CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course!

In this project, I've developed an eBay-like e-commerce auction site where users can easily post auction listings, place bids, comment on items, and manage a personalized "watchlist."
